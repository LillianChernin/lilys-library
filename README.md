# Lily's Library

## Description
Lily's Library is a book managing system for tracking large personal book collections where books have their location listed as well as their availability.  The intent is to make finding and sharing books easier so that books are more likely to be used.  In the app, books can be added, deleted, and updated.  Also a user can checkout books, place books on hold or see when a book will be available next.  This prototype version will only manage my personal library but further expansions will allow users to create their own personal libraries (customized to their books and locations where they are stored) with control over what users can access their library (only their friends or users with the correct credentials for instance).

## Motivation
I have a large book collection that is not being used as well as it could be.  It is currently difficult to find books or to even know what books are there. The motivation for this app is to make an interface where my friends and I can read and use these books more effectively.
I believe that having a slightly more structured borrowing system also encourages people to read since they are given reminders of how long they have had the book and enforcing a timeline of when the books should be read by.
